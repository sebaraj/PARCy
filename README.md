# Processors for the PARCv2 ISA, for CPSC/EENG 420

This repository contains my implementations for four different processors:

## Lab 1: Integer Multiply/Divide Unit

Implemented a hardware block for integer multiplication and division operations, with both iterative and single-cycle versions.

## Lab 2: Pipelined Processor

Implemented various hazard resolution techniques for a 5-stage pipeline, including stalling, bypassing, and long bypassing.

## Lab 3: Superscalar Processor

Designed a superscalar processor with dual-fetch capability and support for parallel instruction execution.

## Lab 4: Out-of-Order and Speculative Execution

Implemented an out-of-order execution processor with a reorder buffer and speculative execution support.
